The Lighthouse Keeper's Secret
The storm had been raging for three days when Thomas first noticed the light. 
Not the lighthouse beam—that familiar sweeping arc that had guided ships safely home for decades—but something else entirely. 
A faint, pulsing glow emanating from beneath the waves, just beyond the rocky outcrop where the lighthouse stood sentinel.
Thomas had been the keeper of Beacon Point Lighthouse for twelve years, 
and in all that time, he'd never seen anything like it. 
He pressed his weathered face against the salt-stained window and squinted into the tempest. 
The sea churned violently, whitecaps exploding like cannon fire against the dark water.
The glow pulsed again—dull green and otherworldly. 
Thomas grabbed his oilskin coat and lantern. 
Something was out there, something that didn't belong in the waters he'd watched over for more than a decade. 
As he descended the spiral staircase to the rocky shore, the wind howled a warning through the lighthouse tower, but Thomas had made up his mind.
The tide was coming in, and whatever secrets lay sleeping beneath the waves would soon be uncovered.
